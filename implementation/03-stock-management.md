## What Was Changed / Fixed

| Date | Change | File |
|------|--------|------|
| 2026-04 | **Inline category creation** — "New" button next to Category in inventory dialog; creates and auto-selects without leaving form | `app/(app)/stock-management/inventory/inventory-dialog.tsx`, `app/(app)/stock-management/categories/actions.ts` |
| 2026-04 | **Inline unit creation** — "New" button next to Unit in inventory dialog; creates and auto-selects including symbol | `app/(app)/stock-management/inventory/inventory-dialog.tsx`, `app/(app)/stock-management/units/actions.ts` |
| 2026-04 | **Inventory dialog scrollbar + UI improvements** — form is now scrollable; labels fit properly on smaller screens | `app/(app)/stock-management/inventory/inventory-dialog.tsx` |
| 2026-04 | **Stock atomicity fix** — `decrement_inventory_stock` and `increment_inventory_stock` Supabase RPCs rewritten with atomic UPDATE pattern; no more silent floor-to-zero | `lib/db/migration-atomicity-fixes.sql` |
| 2026-04 | **quickCreateInventoryItem** — accepts category, unit, barcode, selling price from purchase form | `app/(app)/stock-management/inventory/actions.ts` |
| Recent (8 phases) | Complete multi-tier pricing system implemented | `lib/db/inventory-pricing.ts` |
| Previous | Barcode duplicate race condition fixed (UNIQUE constraint) | DB + `actions.ts` |
| Previous | Added pagination helper to prevent timeout on large lists | `lib/db/pagination-helper.ts` |

## Known Bugs

| # | Bug | Severity | Status |
|---|-----|----------|--------|
| B1 | Stock silent failure — deduction can fail without user knowing | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ Fixed (atomic DB RPC raises exception; caller receives error) |
| B2 | Stock count in `inventory_items` can drift from `stock_movements` sum | 🟡 MEDIUM | ❌ Pending |
| B3 | No search/filter on inventory list | 🟠 HIGH | ❌ Pending |
| B4 | No confirmation dialog before delete | 🟠 HIGH | ❌ Pending |

## Missing Features (for Market)

- [ ] **Search inventory** — by name, barcode, category
- [ ] **Filter by category / low stock / archived**
- [ ] **Confirmation dialog before delete** — "Are you sure?"
- [ ] **Stock adjustment** — manual +/- without a sale/purchase reason (damage, theft, shrinkage)
- [ ] **Bulk import** — CSV upload for adding many products at once
- [ ] **Product images** — photo of item
- [ ] **SKU / item code** — internal code separate from barcode
- [ ] **Stock valuation report** — total inventory worth at cost price vs sale price
- [ ] **Expiry date tracking** — for FMCG items (Pakistani shops sell a lot of perishables)
- [ ] **Reorder point notification** — email/alert when stock hits minimum

---

## Checklist Before Launch

- [ ] Fix silent stock failure in `lib/db/stock-movements.ts`
- [ ] Add search and category filter to inventory list
- [ ] Add confirmation dialog on delete
- [ ] Add manual stock adjustment feature
- [ ] Test stock movements are recorded for all sale/purchase/return operations
- [ ] Verify stock sync between `inventory_items.stock` and sum of `stock_movements`

## Fix: Silent Stock Failure (CRITICAL)

**File:** `lib/db/stock-movements.ts` around line 34-36

Current problem: error is caught and logged to console, but the caller never knows.

```typescript
// WRONG — currently:
catch (error) {
  console.error('Stock movement failed:', error);
  // sale continues even though stock wasn't deducted!
}

// FIX — should be:
catch (error) {
  console.error('Stock movement failed:', error);
  throw new Error(`Stock movement failed: ${error.message}`);
}
```

Then in POS/Invoice actions, wrap in try-catch and return error to user.

---

## Fix: Stock Consistency Check

Add a Supabase function (RPC) or cron job that periodically validates:
```sql
SELECT id, name, stock, 
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(quantity_change), 0) FROM stock_movements WHERE item_id = i.id) AS calculated_stock
FROM inventory_items i
WHERE stock != calculated_stock;
```

Run this weekly and flag discrepancies to admin.
