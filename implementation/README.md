## 🚨 Launch Blockers (Must Fix Before Going Live)

1. **Stock deduction fails silently** — sale succeeds but stock doesn't reduce
2. **No confirmation dialogs** on delete — accidental data loss
3. **No search/filter on list pages** — unusable with real data (50+ items)
4. **Returns don't update invoice status** — accounting is wrong
5. **Invoice state machine broken** — Draft → Cancelled → Draft possible
6. **No password reset** — locked-out users have no recovery
7. **Mobile is broken** — tables overflow on phones
8. **Transaction atomicity** — stock deducted but invoice fails = data corruption
9. **Party ledger shows wrong balance** — credits/debits logic has bugs
