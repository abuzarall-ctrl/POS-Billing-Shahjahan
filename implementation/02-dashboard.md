## Checklist Before Launch

- [ ] Fix UTC vs PKT timezone issue
- [ ] Add low stock alerts widget

- [ ] Add date range selector (Today / This Week / This Month)

## Fix: Timezone (Priority HIGH)

In `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`, all `new Date()` calls need to be converted to PKT.

```typescript
// Add this utility
function getPKTStartOfDay() {
  const now = new Date();
  const pkt = new Date(now.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: 'Asia/Karachi' }));
  pkt.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return pkt;
}
```

## Fix: Low Stock Alert Widget (Priority HIGH)

Query: `inventory_items` where `stock <= minimum_stock` and `minimum_stock > 0`.

Show as a dismissible alert card at top of dashboard with item count and link to inventory.
