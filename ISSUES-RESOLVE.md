## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Resolve First)

### Issue #1: Silent Failures in Stock Movement Recording
- **File:** `lib/db/stock-movements.ts` (line 34-36)
- **Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Stock deductions can fail silently without user notification
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Description:**
  - Error handling doesn't throw, just logs to console
  - Stock movements not recorded but sale still completes
  - Inventory audit trail becomes unreliable
- **Resolution Steps:**
  1. Add error throwing mechanism
  2. Catch in caller and return error to user
  3. Add user-facing error notifications
  4. Log to audit table
- **Estimated Time:** 2 hours

### Issue #2: Incomplete User Data Isolation
- **File:** Multiple files (parties, invoices, purchases, returns)
- **Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Multi-tenant data leak potential
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Description:**
  - Some queries miss `eq("user_id", currentUser.id)` verification
  - Example: `parties/actions.ts:getPartyBalances()`
  - Users could access other users' financial data
- **Resolution Steps:**
  1. Audit all database queries for user_id verification

- **Status:** 🟡 PARTIALLY RESOLVED (Application-level; needs DB-level RPC functions)
- **Description:**
  - Using Promise.all() without transaction handling
  - If one operation fails, others may still execute
  - No rollback mechanism
- **Resolution Steps:**
  1. Implement RPC transaction wrapper in Supabase
